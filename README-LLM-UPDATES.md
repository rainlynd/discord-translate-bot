# Discord Translator Bot LLM Updates

## Summary of Changes

The Discord Translator Bot has been updated to use a more accurate language detection method. Previously, the bot used the `franc` library for language detection, which sometimes failed to properly identify languages, especially with mixed-language content or shorter messages.

## Key Improvements

1. **LLM-Based Language Detection**
   - Now uses GPT-4o-mini to accurately detect whether text is Korean, Japanese, or English
   - More reliable for mixed-language content and short messages
   - Replaces the previous franc-based detection system

2. **Simplified Translation Flow**
   - In Korean mode:
     * Korean text → English
     * English text → Korean
     * Japanese text → Korean
   - In Japanese mode:
     * Japanese text → English  
     * English text → Japanese
     * Korean text → Japanese

3. **Same Great System Prompts**
   - Continues to use the existing system prompts from default.json
   - Maintains the casual, friendly translation style

## Technical Details

- Added `detectLanguageWithLLM` function that uses a small, fast LLM model
- Updated translation service to use this LLM-based detection
- Kept the same mode system ("korean" and "japanese") for consistency

## Benefits

- More accurate language detection
- Improved handling of mixed-language messages
- Better experience for users who send messages with a mix of languages
- Maintains same translation quality with existing model selection

## Usage

The bot usage remains the same:

1. Start a session with `!start`
2. Switch modes with `!mode korean` or `!mode japanese`
3. Change models with `!model gpt4o`, `!model claude`, or `!model gemini` 
4. End the session with `!end`

All messages in an active channel will be automatically translated based on the detected language.
