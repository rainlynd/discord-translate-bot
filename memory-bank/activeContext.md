# Discord Translation Bot - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The Discord Translation Bot is currently in a stable state with a complete implementation of core translation functionality. The project has fully functional capabilities for:

- Session-based translation between English, Korean, and Japanese
- Support for multiple AI models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)
- Performance optimizations using webhooks and translation memory
- Comprehensive Docker support for deployment
- Diagnostic and monitoring utilities

The primary focus is now on:
1. Testing and optimizing LLM-based language detection
2. Improving handling of long messages via content filtering and message splitting
3. Enhancing performance through caching and reduced API calls
4. Ensuring reliability with proper error handling and fallbacks

## Recent Changes

### LLM-Based Language Detection
- Replaced the `franc` library with GPT-4o-mini for more accurate language detection
- Improved handling of mixed-language content and short messages
- Better recognition of casual language patterns and internet slang

### Long Message Handling
- Added message preprocessing to filter out irrelevant content (emojis, timestamps, URLs)
- Implemented intelligent message splitting for content exceeding Discord's 2000 character limit
- Created a fallback system for webhook delivery failures

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented batched disk I/O for translation memory
- Created a buffer system for tracking changes to be written
- Added webhook caching to avoid recreation

## Next Steps

### Short-Term Priorities
1. **Full test suite**: Develop comprehensive testing for all translation workflows
2. **Edge case handling**: Improve handling of mixed messages, very short content, and emoji-heavy text
3. **Rate limit optimization**: Enhance the queue system to better respect provider rate limits
4. **Usage analytics**: Add more detailed performance metrics and analytics

### Medium-Term Considerations
1. **Context-aware translations**: Enhance translation quality by maintaining conversation context
2. **Command enhancements**: Add more user configuration options through commands
3. **Webhook robustness**: Further improve webhook reliability and fallback mechanisms
4. **Cost optimization**: Implement smarter model selection based on translation complexity

### Long-Term Vision
1. **Additional languages**: Framework for extending beyond current language support
2. **Custom system prompts**: User-configurable system prompts for different conversational styles
3. **Voice channel integration**: Potential transcription and translation of voice chat
4. **Admin dashboard**: Web interface for server administrators to configure and monitor the bot

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### LLM Provider Strategy
- Currently supporting all three major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Decision to maintain all three for redundancy and user choice
- Tracking performance and cost metrics to guide future provider recommendations

### Language Detection Approach
- Recent transition to LLM-based detection instead of traditional libraries
- Monitoring accuracy improvements and potential performance impacts
- Need to balance accuracy vs. speed, especially for short messages

### Deployment Considerations
- Docker as primary deployment method with detailed documentation
- PM2 as alternative for simpler hosting environments
- Evaluating resource usage at scale to provide better deployment guidelines

### Performance Balancing
- Current queue system limited to 3 concurrent translations
- Translation memory configured to store up to 500 entries
- Evaluating these limits based on real-world usage patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation with fall-back mechanisms
- Clear user feedback for different error types
- Automatic retry system under consideration for transient failures
