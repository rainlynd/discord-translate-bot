## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Session-based translation in Discord channels
- ✅ Automatic language detection (Korean, Japanese, English)
- ✅ Translation between language pairs based on mode:
  - Korean ↔ English
  - Japanese ↔ English
  - Korean → Japanese
  - Japanese → Korean
- ✅ Multiple AI model support (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)
- ✅ Translation memory for cached responses
- ✅ Multi-server support with server-specific configurations

### User Interface
- ✅ Command system for controlling the bot
- ✅ Visual indicators (emoji reactions) for translation status
- ✅ Formatted translations with language indicators
- ✅ Statistics tracking and reporting
- ✅ Help system with command explanations

### Performance Features
- ✅ Webhook-based responses for speed
- ✅ Message preprocessing to reduce content size
- ✅ Long message splitting for content exceeding Discord limits
- ✅ Translation request queueing with concurrency control
- ✅ Optimized disk I/O for translation memory

### Deployment Options
- ✅ Standard Node.js deployment
- ✅ Docker containerized deployment
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## What's Left to Build

### Short Term
- 🔄 Comprehensive test suite beyond basic scripts
- 🔄 Enhanced error tracking and reporting
- 🔄 Advanced rate limit handling
- 🔄 Performance metrics dashboard

### Medium Term
- ⏳ Context-aware translations (maintaining conversation history)
- ⏳ Additional user configuration options
- ⏳ Server-specific system prompts
- ⏳ Enhanced analytics for usage patterns

### Long Term
- ⏳ Support for additional languages
- ⏳ Voice channel integration
- ⏳ Administrative web dashboard
- ⏳ Integration with other language tools

## Current Status

The Discord Translation Bot is in a fully functional state with all core features implemented. It can be deployed using either standard Node.js or Docker methods and provides real-time translation services between English, Korean, and Japanese.

Recent upgrades to LLM-based language detection and long message handling have enhanced the user experience and translation accuracy. The bot is currently stable and ready for production use, with a focus on improving testing, monitoring, and edge case handling.

## Known Issues

1. **Very short messages** - Detection accuracy can be lower for very short messages (1-3 characters)
2. **Mixed language messages** - While improved with LLM detection, still challenging in some cases
3. **Rate limiting** - Under heavy load, might encounter rate limits from API providers
4. **Memory usage** - Translation memory can grow large with extensive usage
5. **Webhook permissions** - Requires appropriate permissions in Discord for optimal performance
6. **API costs** - Significant usage could lead to substantial API costs

## Next Milestone

The next development milestone focuses on:

1. Creating a comprehensive test suite for all components
2. Implementing enhanced monitoring for rate limits and errors
3. Optimizing API usage patterns for cost efficiency
4. Adding more detailed usage analytics
